                            CNP-A ((Clinical) Neuropsychology Assembly) is an online community dedicated to bringing researchers, clinicians and students in the field of neuropsychology together. Our Discord server provides a space for knowledge sharing/seeking, professional/academic advise-seeking, networking/collaborating among peers in the neuropsychological community.

                        <p>
                            Neuropsychologists in the clinical world have to work with all kinds of patients and need to constantly work on their diagnostic hypotheses, test protocols, testing and interpreting the obtained results - let alone consider many medical, neurological and psychiatric factors.<br>
							If you are a clinician and wish to share or ask for information, or simply want to connect with others in the field, this is a great place to look!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you study topics in neuropsychology or if you managed to accidentally end up in this corner of science during one of your literature searches, our server is a great place to ask around! You can talk all things regarding studying within or related to the field.<br>
							If you want to connect with other people, this is also possible as long as they are open to this as well!

                    CNP-A is <i>the</i> platform for all things neuropsychology! We are building a community where people can easily communicate with other professionals in the related fields. This way, you get to discuss with other people who could be knowledgable on the topic you want to know more of! 
					It is an informal, yet professional space, where we foster a positive learning environment where it is okay not to be an expert on everything, because we don't all have the same background. Nor should we! Exchanging perspectives from different specialisations/disciplines could lead to so much more understanding, even if we are not learning everything about the other discipline.
					We have channels to talk about cognition, neurological conditions, psychiatric conditions. Here you can exchange scientific information and ask questions about the topic or discuss them. We also have channels for seeking advice / sharing information about clinical work and research, careers and studying.
					We welcome all professionals and students who are (interested) in these/related fields!
